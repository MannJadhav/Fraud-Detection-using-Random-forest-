Fraud Detection Using Random Forest in Google Colab
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook for building a fraud detection system using the Random Forest algorithm. The model aims to identify fraudulent transactions in financial datasets by analyzing key features.

Features:

    1. Interactive Environment: Easy-to-use notebook format for experimentation and collaboration.
    2. Data Preprocessing: Steps for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
    3. Random Forest Classifier: Implements ensemble learning to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
    4. Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

The Colab notebook includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to help you understand each step of the process. Perfect for anyone interested in applying machine learning to real-world finance problems.

Feel free to fork, modify, and use this code for your own projects!
