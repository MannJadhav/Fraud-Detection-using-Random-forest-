# 📰 AI-Based Fake News Detector

This repository contains an **AI-based Fake News Detection System** that classifies news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using **Naïve Bayes Classifier** based on **Bayes' Theorem**. The model is trained using **TF-IDF vectorization** and can be deployed for real-time detection.

---

## 📌 Features
- **Dataset**: Uses the Fake & Real News Dataset from Kaggle
- **Algorithm**: Naïve Bayes (Bayes' Theorem)
- **Libraries Used**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Model Deployment**: Save & Load model using Pickle

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of real and fake news articles, with labeled categories:
- `fake.csv`: Contains fake news articles.
- `true.csv`: Contains real news articles.

To download the dataset directly from Kaggle, use:
```python
!pip install kaggle
!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
!echo '{"username":"YOUR_USERNAME","key":"YOUR_API_KEY"}' > ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
!kaggle datasets download -d clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset --unzip
```

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Fake-News-Detector.git
cd Fake-News-Detector
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Train the Model
```python
python train.py
```

### 4️⃣ Test the Model
```python
python test.py
```

### 5️⃣ Save & Load the Model
```python
import pickle

# Save Model
with open("fake_news_model.pkl", "wb") as model_file:
    pickle.dump(model, model_file)

# Load Model
with open("fake_news_model.pkl", "rb") as model_file:
    loaded_model = pickle.load(model_file)
```

## 📊 Data Visualization
To visualize the dataset, use the following code:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df_fake = pd.read_csv("Fake.csv")
df_real = pd.read_csv("True.csv")

# Data distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
sns.countplot(y=["Fake"]*len(df_fake) + ["Real"]*len(df_real))
plt.title("Fake vs Real News Distribution")
plt.show()
```
